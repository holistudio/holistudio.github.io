Hi! I'm a design technologist currently investigating the use of virtual reality, wearables, and machine learning in architectural design and construction processes as a PhD researcher at the [Building Informatics Lab](https://bilab.engineering.nyu.edu/) at New York University. My main interests are in questions at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and the built environment, such as:

 - How can architects collaborate with AI to design buildings?
 - How can VR and wearables help identify what people want from their spaces? 
 - How can your surrounding environment elegantly adapt to your changing needs?

Beyond that, I'm always up for using my coding and design skills for any form of storytelling: photography, music, film, graphic design.
