Hi! I'm a design technologist currently investigating the use of virtual reality, wearables, and machine learning in architectural design and construction processes as a PhD researcher at the Building Informatics Lab at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My main interests are at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and the built environment.
