Hi! I'm a design technologist and researcher currently investigating the use of virtual reality, wearables, and machine learning in architectural design and construction processes as a PhD researcher at the [Building Informatics Lab](https://bilab.engineering.nyu.edu/) at New York University. 

My main interests are in generative AI and human computer interaction, particularly in [applications for designers](https://holistudio.github.io/2023/06/14/project_spaceship/) of all kinds (architects, engineers, kids with Legos). My past experience in architectural engineering and current dissertation on [VR and AI to develop wearables for traffic construction workers](https://holistudio.github.io/2023/05/05/worker_safety/) is fueling my interests in those topics, albeit in a different application domain.

Beyond that, I'm always up for using my coding and design skills for any form of storytelling: data visualization, graphic design, photography, music, film.
