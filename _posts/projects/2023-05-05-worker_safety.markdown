While maintaining public streets and highways, roadway construction workers have to balance their attention to completing their tasks with their overall safety in relation to the surrounding traffic vehicles moving around their work zone.

My current PhD dissertation investigates using VR to collect detailed data on how construction workers behave near dangerous vehicles (e.g., speeding cars) and how wearable devices (e.g., smartwatch alarms) can improve their safety. More info upon request by contacting dbl299 [at] nyu [dot] edu.
