While maintaining public streets and highways, roadway construction workers have to balance their attention to completing their tasks with their overall safety in relation to the surrounding traffic vehicles moving around their work zone.

My current PhD dissertation investigates using VR to collect data on how construction workers react (e.g., head turn, evade with body) to dangerous vehicles (e.g., speeding cars) and how AI can raise effective notifications on wearable devices (e.g., smartwatch alarms) of various modalities (e.g., sound, haptics) to ensure their safety.
