In the United States, buildings account for 28% of total primary energy usage and 40% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Some studies estimate energy costs could be reduced by up to 20% by better sealing the building envelope. While building energy audits and envelope inspections are necessary to maintain a building's energy efficiency and structural safety, professional inspections are expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to inspectors.
