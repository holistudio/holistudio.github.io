The healthcare industry has recently been facing a number of technological trends, like telemedicine, health tracking wearables, and AI-augmented tools. These trends are changing what patients expect out of their doctor's visit and changing how medical staff expect to work in outpatient practices. Architects and engineers need to rethink their process of designing an outpatient clinic's physical space and building systems to be more flexible and adaptive to these changing expectations.

Responsive environment technologies (robotic furniture, smart lighting, etc.) can provide the means to improve the flexibility of spaces. Though they have found some initial success in residential spaces, these innovations have yet to be applied to outpatient clinic spaces.

Initial investigations into such applications have developed virtual reality models of robotic furniture and wall transformations: how a physician office can transform into a patient room (above left), how workspaces can transform into a meeting room between physicians and their assistants (above right). Medical staff later interacted with these VR models in real-time and expressed an entusiasm for these ideas and concerns for how they fit into their usual workflows.

Future work should specifically identify the critical needs of outpatient clinic occupants, be they medical staff or patients, and map them to appropriate responsive environment technologies. By integrating considerations of how the physical space should be designed and how interactive technologies should serve occupants, architects and engineers can create spaces that enable outpatient practices to operate more effectively and better serve their patients with a quality experience.
