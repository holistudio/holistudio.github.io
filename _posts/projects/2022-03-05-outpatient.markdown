The healthcare industry has recently been facing a number of technological trends, like telemedicine, health tracking wearables, and AI-augmented tools. These trends raise the general question of what people (patients and medical staff) expect out of their outpatient clinic spaces, and consequently require architects and engineers to reconsider how those spaces need to be designed to meet those changing needs. Though responsive environment technologies (robotic furniture, smart lighting, etc.) have found some initial success in residential spaces, these innovations have yet to be applied to outpatient clinic spaces.

Initial investigations into such applications have developed virtual models robotic furniture and wall concepts and shown them to medical staff for their impressions: how a physician office can transform into a patient room, how workspaces can transform into a meeting room between physicians and their assistants.

The general goal should be to identify the critical needs of outpatient clinic occupants, be they medical staff or patients, and map them to appropriate responsive environment technologies (robotic furniture, smart lighting, etc.). Achieving this goal will likely require early consideration of such technologies and development of mockups (virtual or physical) demonstrating their responsive interactions to all potential stakeholders. 

By integrating considerations of how the physical space should be designed and how interactive technologies should serve occupants, outpatient practices will operate more effectively and better serve their patients with a quality experience.
