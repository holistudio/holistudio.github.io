Like all martial arts, taichi started as a combat system, but gradually evolved into a practice for health, wellness, and competitive sports. A mixed reality experience was designed to illustrate how taichi developed.

The walled environment's different forms were derived from different types of sensor data collected from the same martial arts movement: an accelerometer on the right fist, a camera with body pose detection software.
