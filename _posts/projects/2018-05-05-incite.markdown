Like all martial arts, taichi started as a combat system, but gradually evolved into a practice for health, wellness, and competitive sports. A mixed reality experience was designed to reveal how taichi developed over its long history and raise questions about how traditions struggle in modern society.

As a person goes through the timeline of taichi's development, their surrounding natural and walled environment would also change.

The walled environment's different forms were derived from different types of sensor data collected from the same martial arts movement: an accelerometer on the right fist, a camera with body pose detection software.
