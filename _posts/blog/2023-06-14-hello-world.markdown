Hello world! 

After many years of learning computer programming, I finally decided to make my own personal webpage outside of Squarespace. Don't get me wrong, Squarespace has its usefulness - like for me when I was still learning web frameworks but needed to show a design portfolio of projects to potential grad school programs and employers.

Lately though, I felt that it was a bit silly to keep paying that subscription fee while I am now a pretty confident programmer of sorts. Having ChatGPT helps too (though it took me a while before I realized it was suggesting code using Jekyll version 4.x!).

Here's to a more fun (and free) time finangling with Jekyll on a Github page!
