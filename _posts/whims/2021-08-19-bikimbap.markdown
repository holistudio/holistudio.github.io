I love eating dolsot bibimbap for its variety of flavors and textures: soft white rice, warm egg, spicy gochujang, all sorts of veggies, and, most importantly, the crispy rice at the bottom of the hot stone bowl. I usually struggle to get all those things in one bite...

So I messed around in my kitchen and came up with a way to arrange them in a kimbap form.
