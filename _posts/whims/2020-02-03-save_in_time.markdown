In this game, a player has to manipulate objects in a snow cabin, travel through time, and find their friend, all before global warming irreversibly alters their surrounding environment.


A basic Unity prototype was first developed to test the time travel and climate change effects as the player interacts with objects inside the cabin. The forest procedurally generates different amounts of green and dead trees the "current year." As the years increase further into future, the total number of trees decreases exponentially while the fraction of dead trees increases.

This was my first time making a Unity 3D game basically from scratch, for NYU's DM-GY 9103 Remixing Reality: Social Dreaming in MR, Spring 2020. It later became a useful code basis for [experiments in responsive outpatient clinic spaces](https://holistudio.github.io/2022/03/05/outpatient/).
